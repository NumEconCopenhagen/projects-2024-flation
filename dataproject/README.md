# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Return to schooling in the EU** and is about how return to schooling differs among the EU countries as well as how it correlates with wealth and education investments.

The **results** and data processing of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Data_Government_Expenditures.dta (*[source](https://amory-gethin.fr/data.html)*) 
1. Data_Return_To_Schooling.dta (*[source](https://amory-gethin.fr/data.html)*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further installations.
